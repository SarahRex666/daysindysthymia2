        I. The crunch tires make over gravel the sound of water through fog. I
        know here and now that I love you. II. We still play pretend grown ups.
        You dress up for me, we dance through time like the girl on top of a
        music box. III. I had forgotten the fire that left us this way. The
        snapping sounds of breaking memories, The warmth of the flames on my
        cheek. You comb your hair with your fingers and ash falls to the floor
        like new snow.
