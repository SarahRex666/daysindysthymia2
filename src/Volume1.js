        I.
        <br />
        <br />
        Place your ear to the wall <br />
        quiet your breath. <br />
        Listen to the hum of the world. <br />
        Feel part of it, <br />
        Feel as if you will always be separate. <br />
        <br />
        II. <br />
        <br />
        Everything isn’t serious. I’ll give you an example.
        <br />
        Softly suspending your grandmother’s hand in yours <br />
        as she steadily quieted into death, <br />
        the family, home and already grieving, leaving you alone <br />
        to be the steward of her pain. Calling your father to tell him <br />
        his mother died, holding onto what it sounded like when she took
        <br />
        her last breath. These are serious things. <br />
        <br />
        By contrast, I once walked into a window of a crowded bank <br />
        mistaking it for a door. My forehead hit the pane hard, <br />
        it sounded like a large china bowl being dropped onto the ground <br />
        but somehow, not breaking. <br />
        <br />
        III.
        <br />
        <br />
        I met a woman who carried death with her everywhere she went. It was a
        stillness that stunk of old flowers and cigarettes. She was a perfectly
        nice woman. Nothing about her personality or her behavior made me feel
        this way. Just a complete and unending certainty that she was a
        harbinger. She talked of dead pets, dead friends, dead parents, of art
        and of love. These were the things she was an expert in. Her shoulders
        straightened, gaze evened. The look of an athlete about to run the big
        race.
        <br />
        <br />
        She was an unwitting harbinger. She took no more pleasure in being
        followed by death than anyone else would. Her pale wavy hair wild and
        uncontrollable, my sitting across from her as still as stone. Off in the
        distance, maybe outside, I heard a hiss and the movement of leaves. When
        she departed, something in me left with her. After the door closed and
        her car pulled away I collapsed in bed and slept for fourteen hours.
        <br />

        IV.
        <br />
        <br />
        Everything is quiet again, B. <br />
        This is why I gave up poetry the first time.
        <br />
        When it’s quiet the fear comes. <br />
        The belt around my chest, it tightens. <br />
        I’m afraid of myself. <br />
        I’m afraid of the unlit corners <br />
        and dusty doorways. <br />
        What if I never find my way home to you? <br />
        Why must I feel the need <br />
        to speak where no one needs
        <br />
        sound?
        <br />
        <br />
        V.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sometimes the lie is so much lovelier than the truth. I’ll give you an
        example: I know that the first words ever spoken were probably something
        like water or lion or run or fire, something necessary, something vital.
        But I like to believe that maybe after thousands of years of silence,
        someone looked at someone and said, “I wonder if those stars watch us
        every night like we watch them.” I think that would be nice, don’t you?
        Or maybe if God came down one Tuesday afternoon and everybody got out of
        their cars or walked out of their incredibly important jobs and he just
        said, “what are you in a rush for all the time? I made all of this soft
        grass, lie in it.” <br />
        <br />
        VI. <br />
        <br />I heard the guru on the television say <br />
        forgiving yourself is the greatest act of kindness.
        <br />
        He sat in condescending splendor, arms folded <br />
        knees crossed, surrounded on all sides by faithful followers. <br />I
        remember my mother in the intensive care unit. I remember <br />
        the faint conversations we had over the sound of respirators <br />
        and nurses shoes squeaking on waxed floor. I remember the days I <br />
        would come and sit alone while you slept. I was a coward, then. <br />I
        didn’t tell you how sorry I was for all of my teenage angst and <br />
        all the nights I was out and manic and you were home and waiting <br />
        and worrying. <br />I am still a coward now. <br />
        Maybe the guru was right. <br />
        Maybe forgiving myself really is the greatest act of kindness. <br />
        But I don’t make a habit
        <br />
        of forgiving those I hate.
        <br />
        <br />
        VI.
        <br />
        <br />
        I remember driving home
        <br />
        from the third day at the factory thinking <br />
        I am not cut out for this world
        <br />
        as if there was a blurry outline drawn on a sheet
        <br />
        of construction paper of a boy
        <br />
        who would grow up to be a man
        <br />
        who would be afraid of the dark <br />
        and of men who reminded him of his father
        <br />
        and of small talk with cashiers who seem too friendly
        <br />
        and of falling back into solitude <br />
        and of dying <br />
        who when cut out and blown into the wind
        <br />
        of some faraway place would take running
        <br />
        out and over the horizon
        <br />
        lit on each side by shadow <br />
        cast by the two moons of that world.
        <br />
        it would be soft and peaceful
        <br />
        he would smile easy
        <br />
        and never remember the names
        <br />
        of all of the prescription drugs
        <br />
        he would never need.

        <br />
        <br />
        When I was in second grade <br />
        I pretended to know all the answers to an episode of Jeopardy!. <br />I
        had seen the episode before, but my friend’s parents didn’t know that.{" "}
        <br />
        It’s the opposite of “malafide” <br />
        Bonafide, obviously. <br />
        Persephone, who reigned with him over the underworld, was his niece
        <br />
        I’m pretty sure this one’s Hades.
        <br />
        They were astonished, maybe a bit frightened. <br />
        For an evening I was the kid genius,
        <br />
        The star attraction.
        <br />
        When my mom came to pick me up they gushed,
        <br />
        my god your son is so smart!
        <br />
        We stopped for ice cream on the way home for “no reason.”
        <br />
        It was the first time I ever learned how good it felt
        <br />
        to be a fraud. <br />
        But I would spend the next 25 years feeling like one. <br />
        <br />
        IX. <br />
        <br />
        Last night I thought about crashing my car into a tollbooth. I saw it
        about a mile before, glowing like a lighthouse. It wasn’t a thought,
        really. It was like a feeling. I didn’t want to die, I wanted to hear
        the sound it made. That splash of metal slamming into metal that makes
        the hair on your neck stand up. I wanted to see the look on everybody’s
        faces when they saw I wasn’t slowing down. I wanted to feel the airbag
        on my cheek. I wanted to smell the gasoline running out onto the
        pavement. I didn’t want to die, I think I just wanted someone to run to
        me.

        A good line is like a shard of a mirror. <br />
        You find it, you examine it. <br />
        <br />
        You see yourself <br />
        reflected back at you.

        When asked about what his intention was for writing films, Ingmar
        Bergman responded, “There is an old story of how the cathedral of
        Chartres was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. Then
        thousands of people came from all points of the compass, like a giant
        procession of ants, and together they began to rebuild the cathedral on
        its old site. They worked until the building was completed — master
        builders, artists, laborers, clowns, noblemen, priests, burghers. But
        they all remained anonymous, and no one knows to this day who built the
        cathedral of Chartres.”

        XII.
        <br />
        <br />
        I want to die on the steps of my own cathedral.
        <br />
        That is all I could ever ask for. <br />
        <br />
        XIII.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hold your hand to the earth. <br />
        Feel the warmth and the magnetism of it,
        <br />
        how it pulls your hand deeper into itself. <br />
        Remember how the sky looked on the day you died. <br />
        The endless grey and white sky, the cold wind <br />
        on your cheeks. What does it mean
        <br />
        to be laid to rest? <br />
        <br />
        XIV. <br />
        <br />
        The first time I took Seroquel I fell asleep inside of a burrito. <br />
        I was sitting in my childhood bedroom
        <br />
        watching TV and eating dinner. <br />I was 21 and I still thought the
        world was still a generally good place. <br />
        I told my doctor that I think about killing myself every day. <br />
        <br />
        XV.
        <br />
        <br />
        I reached into my mouth and pulled a small stone from the place where my
        right lower cuspid used to be. I pulled it out and looked at it a while.
        It sat there in my hand, wet and gleaming. It was grey and perfectly
        round. Something swelled from inside me. It was something with weight.
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        Open up yourself. <br />
        As wide as it will go. <br />
        It’s the only way I know how. <br />
        <br />
        XVII. <br />
        <br />
        These all feel like love poems to me. <br />
        Do they feel like love poems to you?
        <br />
        <br />
        XVIII.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sometimes it feels a bit disingenuous,
        <br />
        this whole poetry thing. <br />
        A bit stuffy, if you will. <br />
        I’m not always such a serious person. <br />
        By way of example, here’s a poem I wanted to write:
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>
          Did you know that beavers are responsible for over half of the
          deforestation in North America? <br />
          Honestly I think I just made that up.
        </i>{" "}

        <br />
        XIX.
        <br />
        <br />
        The harbinger takes pictures of you. You always hated getting your
        picture taken. You hate any reminder of what your face looks like. Can
        you feel it? The hot ember inside your belly? That is what it feels like
        to hate your own flesh. The harbinger makes you remember flesh. Every
        time the shutter closes you feel pieces of you being taken away. You
        watch them, little bits of skin and sinew float toward the lens like so
        many feathers. The ember grows hotter. You feel the empty space where
        your tooth used to be and the gravel crunches underneath as the
        harbinger packs her things.

        <br />
        <br />
        Days like today I wonder what my soul looks like. <br />
        Maybe it smiles up at me like a child knowing everything
        <br />
        The bottle of scotch half-drank in the cupboard, <br />
        the lace of your dress swaying in the closet. <br />
        Some days it is as dim as a matchstick, <br />
        or still like the curtains when we took out the air
        <br />
        conditioner on the first day of September.
        <br />
        <br />
        XXI.
        <br />
        <br />I remember the moment I knew I was sick. My therapist asked me,{" "}
        <i>how many times a day do you think about dying? </i>It wasn’t the
        question that did it for me, it was the look on her face when I answered
        her. <br />
        <br />
        XXII. <br />
        <br />
        I was twenty-six when I was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive
        disorder. I knew there were months where I couldn’t speak to other
        people because all I could think of was dying. I was in the shower
        writing eulogies for my family in my head. I knew this wasn’t the way
        things were supposed to be. She gave me meds for the thoughts. Now I
        only think of dying a few times a day. I can still see the black sludge
        peeking through the cracks between doors. I can still feel it under my
        feet as it comes up through the floor.
        <br />
        <br />
        XXIII.
        <br />
        <br />
        I remember the first time I heard the word, dysthymia. <br />
        He was my second psychiatrist. He had a bushy grey mustache
        <br />
        and wore loose fitting shirts. <br />
        <br />
        XXIV. <br />
        <br />
        I saw a woman picking up sticks this morning. She was standing outside
        of the fenced lot the phone company owns. There was barbed wire along
        the top. One white oak tree hung over it, a remnant of the old pine
        barrens on the east end of Long Island. Most were destroyed to make room
        for cash crops, vineyards and summer homes. Besides the one tree there
        was nothing but weeds and overgrown grass inside. I don’t know why they
        would keep people out of an empty lot. But the woman was there, picking
        up sticks of uniform length and thickness and bundling them under her
        arm. She examined each as if they were slipped under the plexiglass of a
        pawnshop. These were precious things. As she bent to pick them up her
        white and grey and black and brown hair fell off her shoulder and nearly
        touched the ground. I wanted to help her but I didn’t, I just didn’t.

        The days are feeling heavier. The belt around my chest is tightening.
        I’m scared all the time, B. Sometimes at night I can hear them
        scratching the windows to come inside. It sounds like sand moving across
        pavement. I don’t know what they are, but I don’t want them inside. You
        can hear them too right? Feel them? Just outside of your vision pulling
        on the parts that make you human. They make me dream of dying. They make
        me dream of being alone. They make me dream of early mornings with no
        ending. They make me want to kill myself but I can’t.

        Poems are for afternoons. <br />
        Poems are golden and lazy,
        <br />
        too short for their own good. <br />
        I have relearned almost all <br />
        of the bad habits that my education <br />
        tried to take from me. <br />
        <br />
        XXVII.
        <br />
        <br />
        I dream about it sometimes.
        <br />
        Not with a rope or a gun
        <br />
        or pills. Just a moment of weightlessness.
        <br />
        The car hanging in the air like a bumble bee,
        <br />
        falling from the bridge. I smile <br />
        knowing I finally made a decision for myself. <br />
        <br />
        XXVIII.
        <br />
        <br />
        The harbinger is here again. Her face is like a fun-house mirror. I know
        it is my reflection I see, but something isn’t right. She is here and
        you are talking to her like there is nothing wrong in the world. I smile
        politely, keep vigilant. The harbinger is sitting on a bar stool and you
        are sitting next to her, laughing. She crosses her legs and I see some
        of it drip from the bottom of her shoe. It is thicker than honey and
        black like burnt meat. I remember the smell from the night it tried to
        come into my room. It had the faintest scent of sharpening metal and
        dead flowers. I spent the rest of the night watching and listening. When
        we got home I cried to you and I couldn’t stop.

        Klonopin tastes like valentines hearts<br></br>
        when you let them dissolve under your tongue.<br></br>
        One time I took Seroquel and fell asleep<br></br>
        while eating a burrito. I slept for twelve hours<br></br>
        before I woke up, sitting in a chair with rice in my hair. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        They had tried everything they could think of<br></br>
        but nothing could make a dent in it. <br></br>
        They tried tricyclics from the 70’s, anti-psychotics,<br></br>
        amphetamines, and every antidepressant available. <br></br>
        Under all of it, this dream of death <br></br>
        heaving and shrinking like breathing.<br></br>

        <i>“There is work to be done, but I won’t do it.”</i>
        <br></br>I was talking to my poet friend the other day about this book.
        I told her I’ve been having a hell of a time writing it. I told her I
        was scared of failing. I told her I was scared of being alone with my
        own thoughts. I told her I was scared. Even now I am stuck cowering from
        my own sadness. What a heavy thing it is to carry around with you.{" "}

        It was morning and it was destructive. <br></br>
        The light leaked in through the windows<br></br>
        of the rental cabin we were staying in. <br></br>
        It was like water buckling a boat’s floor. <br></br>
        The sounds of life being lived all around,<br></br>I hated it. I hate
        the morning<br></br>
        and everything it drags with it. <br></br>
        Give me dark and dreamless sleep. <br></br>
        Give me weightlessness. <br></br>
        Give me the silence of night. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Mornings have always been for those of us<br></br>
        without much to sleep for. <br></br>

        <br></br>
        The smell of smoked cigarettes <br></br>
        and the taste of skunked beer. <br></br>
        These are the things my soul is made of. <br></br>
        Poems come from those places sometimes. <br></br>
        They are cockroaches crawling out<br></br>
        from under garbage bags <br></br>
        and cardboard boxes. <br></br>I scoop one up sometimes<br></br>
        put it in a glass jar with some air holes. <br></br>
        <br></br>I watch it for a while<br></br>
        before I let it go, back into the world <br></br>
        <br></br>
